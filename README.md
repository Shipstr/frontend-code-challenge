We have created a bare-bones Vue and React app in directories `vue-spa` and `react-spa`.

We encourage you to demonstrate your workflow via Git commits with good messages. It's important to note that it's by no means a test...we just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems.

When you are done, please either zip up your repo or provide a link to download it and email it to koho.engineering@expeditors.com. If you need to clarify anything regarding this challenge, feel free to email us at koho.engineering@expeditors.com.
