# Koho Front-End Code Challenge

## Overview
To complete this challenge we would like for you to consume `rates.json` file and display a table with providers and rates.
* The table should be able to sort on `Provider` and `Total`.
* The table should be filterable by currency.
* Style the table using UI/UX best practices.

### To Start
We have created a bare-bones Vue and React app in directories `vue-spa` and `react-spa`.

Select which project (Vue or React) you would like to work with, cd into it and follow the README.md instructions to set up the project and begin.

We encourage you to demonstrate your workflow via Git commits with good messages. It's important to note that it's by no means a test...we just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems.

### To Submit
When you are done, please either zip up your repo or provide a link to download it and email it to koho.engineering@expeditors.com. If you need to clarify anything regarding this challenge, feel free to email us at the email above.

We are providing two files which shows our table designs in `table-desktop.png` and `table-mobile.png`. Feel free to use these as an example of what the table should look like.

### Expectations
This challenge is expected to be completed in 1-2 hours. The main intent is to show is for you to show us your process, your thinking, your solution and how well you implement the front-end and styles that are left open-ended.
